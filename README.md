# nowplaying

One-page clojure application to show what is playing on my favorite classical stations. See it on heroku [here](http://nowplaying.tristanmedia.com/).

This version uses liberator to provide an API for jQuery to load the latest feeds and refresh the feed.

The all-clojure version is [here](https://github.com/bhoggard/nowplaying).
